# Capstone-Project-2-Regression---Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
Capstone Project 2 : Regression - Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

Currently Rental bike are being Introduced in many Urban Cities. Bike sharing is a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation that allows people to rent bikes from one location and return them to another. Bike sharing systems are becoming increasingly popular in urban areas, as they provide a low-cost and flexible alternative to public transit or private vehicles.

However, bike sharing systems also face challenges such as balancing the supply and demand of bikes across different time periods for every hour, ensuring the availability and lessening the waiting time. and maintenance of bikes, and optimizing the pricing and promotion strategies.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the hourly demand of bikes in the city, using historical data and other relevant features.

The main steps of the project are:

**1. Basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).:** I have performed basic EDA to understand the data and its characteristics.

 Also, have used Univariate - BI variate - and Multivarite analysis to Understanding the correlation between variables and to explore distribution and intercation of variables.

 Also have also used visualization techniques such as histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, etc. to display the results of EDA.

**2. Hypothesis testing :** I have performed hypothesis testing to test the relationship between the variables. 

  Also have used statistical tests such as t-test, ANOVA, chi-square test. to compare the means or proportions of different groups or categories.


**3. Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing. :** to create and select the most relevant and informative features for the model. 

  Also have used methods such as correlation analysis variance threshold, etc. to select the best Numerical features for the model. For Categorical variable the result of Hypothesis testing is used.

  Also have also performed data cleaning, Scaling and transformation to prepare the data for modeling.

**4. ML Model Development and Evaluation :** In this project Have developed and evaluated different machine learning Models. Have used both Distance based algorithm Linear and Polynomial Regression. Also have used Tree Based Algorithm. 

  Used Different techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, regularization, etc. to optimize the model parameters and performance.

  Evaluated the model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), r2 and Adjusted r2.

**5. Model Interpretation and Explanation :** explained the model predictions using methods such as SHAP values.

  It helped to analyzes the effect of different factors on the demand and identifies the key drivers and patterns of bike sharing demand.

**6. pickle file format for deployment process. :** save the final model in a pickle file format, which is a binary file that can store any Python object. 

  The pickle file format allows the model to be easily loaded and used for deployment process.
